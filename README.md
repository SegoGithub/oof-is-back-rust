## How is this better than [oof-is-back](https://github.com/SegoGithub/oof-is-back)?
1. Rewritten in Rust which means smaller file sizes and faster application.
2. Cross-platform (soon)

## Why I made this?
After Roblox changed the oof sound I started to replace it with custom sounds, I wanted an easier way to change the death sound. So I made this app. Also to help other people easily change their oof sound.

## How to compile

[Prerequisites](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

cargo build --release
```
